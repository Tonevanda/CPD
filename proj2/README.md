##### How to run the code

The code is divided in 2 parts: The Server and the Client. To first run our program, it is necessary to run the server. To do this,
simply compile the Server.java that is located in the src directory. We can compile it using 

```
javac Server.java
```

And run it using:

```
java Server
```

Or we can just simply click on the play button in the top right when selected the Server file to run:

Afterwards, we will just let the Server remain in the background running. Now's the time to 
start connecting Clients to the Server. To connect various Clients we found that the best way was to open a different terminal window for each one.
We then compile the Client class using javac like we did with the Server, and then run it, again using the same commands as in the server.


We can now interact with the server using the different terminal windows as a different Client. And we can send messages by typing in the terminal and clicking enter to send it.
The other steps to run our program are given by the server to the client.
