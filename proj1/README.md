# Part 1 - Performance Evaluation of a single core

## Exercise 1

>Download the example file from moodle that contains the basic algorithm in C/C++ that multiplies two matrices, i.e. multiplies one line of the first matrix by each column of the second matrix (matrixproduct.cpp). Implement the same algorithm in another programming language (just one), such as JAVA, C#, Fortran, etc, of your choice.

>Register the processing time for the two languages of implementation, for input matrices from 600x600 to 3000x3000 elements with increments in both dimensions of 400. Use â€“O2 as optimization flag in C++.
